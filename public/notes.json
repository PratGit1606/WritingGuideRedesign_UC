    "content": "In The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald uses symbolism to convey the corruption of the American Dream. The green light at the end of Daisy's dock represents Gatsby's hopes and dreams for the future. The valley of ashes symbolizes the moral and social decay hidden by the fa√ßade of wealth. The eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg represent the eyes of God looking down on a morally bankrupt society.",
